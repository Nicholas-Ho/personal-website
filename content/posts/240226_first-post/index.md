## Welcome!

Today marks the launch of this website, in all its unfinished glory. Have a look around, and if there's any feedback do let me know!

While this is most definitely a testing page (wow, Hugo has some really neat indexing features), I would also like to celebrate actually launching a personal website. It was something that I had planned to do for ages but never finished - mostly because I insisted on building a dynamic website with React and Node.JS from the ground-up. The spirit of learning was appeased, but I got distracted by other things I found more interesting (like my VR-robotics fourth-year project!). I have since graduated and moved on to work, but am still making time for my own projects, of which this is one.

## Technical details

This is a static website built with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), themed with [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/). Using Markdown to define websites is clever and perfect for simple websites such as this (and for people like me, who do not have an affinity for front-end).

Hosting is done on GitHub Pages, with access via a custom domain planned or implemented, depending on when you're reading this. I was originally thinking of hosting this on my own server (Raspberry Pi 4) that I'm using for my private services, but the security implications of exposing it to the wider internet ultimately prompted me to use a hosting service instead. (At the time of writing, it is also down - I need to troubleshoot when I get back from my trip.)

Once again, welcome and see you around!
