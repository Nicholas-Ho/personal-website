👋 **Hi, I’m Nicholas.** I’m a Technology Graduate Associate at LSEG, working in Post Trade Engineering with a focus on DevSecOps.

---

✨ I work across the DevOps lifecycle, developing CI/CD pipelines and automating engineering workflows to help teams deliver faster, safer, and with fewer manual steps.

☁️ I manage AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Gruntwork patterns to build scalable, consistent, and production‑ready environments.

🔧 I work across core platform areas including secrets management, PKI, networking, and observability with Datadog, ensuring systems are secure, reliable, and fully observable.
